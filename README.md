# Hi, I’m Reaksa 👋

Backend Developer specializing in Python, Django, and API driven systems. I build production oriented backend services with a focus on clean architecture, security, and scalability.

---

## What I Do
I build backend systems that reflect real world business needs - not just CRUD apps. I enjoy solving problems around:

- Real business logic and domain modeling
- Backend architecture & system design
- Async processing & background jobs
- Databases and data consistency

### Areas I Focus On
- Designing RESTful APIs used by real applications
- Modeling business domains (inventory, orders, users, permissions)
- Writing testable, maintainable backend code
- Preparing systems for production deployment

I prefer projects that simulate real world backend work, including role based access control, transactions & data integrity, async workflows, and environment based configuration.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python
- Django, Django REST Framework
- FastAPI (learning / adopting)
- JWT Authentication & OAuth2
- Celery + Redis

### Databases
- MySql
- PostgreSQL
- Database modeling & query optimization

### DevOps / Deployment
- Docker
- Railway (deployment)
- Gunicorn
- Environment based settings
- Linux

### Testing
- pytest
- pytest-django
- API & async task testing

## Featured Project — Inventory Management System (Backend)
A production ready backend system designed around real business workflows.

- Tech: Django · DRF · PostgreSQL · Celery · Redis · JWT  
- Status: Deployed & tested  
- Tests: 35 passing tests (domain, API, async)

Live API & Swagger:  
https://inventory-management-backend-production-7584.up.railway.app/

Repository:  
https://github.com/longreaksa404/inventory-management-backend

Highlights:
- Role based access control (RBAC)
- Multi warehouse inventory tracking
- Stock transactions with audit trail
- Purchase & sales order workflows
- Async email notifications
- Production ready configuration

This project was built as a portfolio grade backend system, not a tutorial app.

## What I’m Working On Next
- Deepening FastAPI knowledge (async first backends)
- Building a transaction & order processing service with FastAPI
- Improving backend system design skills
- Preparing for backend job interviews

---

## Career Goal
I aim to work as a backend developer where I can:
- Design and maintain scalable APIs
- Work on real systems used by real users
- Grow into advanced backend & system design roles
